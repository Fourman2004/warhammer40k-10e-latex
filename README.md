LaTeX template for mock Warhammer 40k documentation for 10th edition

# Intro

Hi, and thank you for taking a look at the 10e LaTex Detachment template. This is a tempalte based off of [This Repo](https://github.com/natfarleydev/warhammer40k-latex.git), and is small alterations. I do not claim to be responsible for the creation of it nor the author of the Author.

With that said, Please look at all README's in this repository, as they will contain vital information on going about Creating Detachments.

## What is LaTeX?
If you are New to this, you will not know what LaTeX (Pronounced Lay-Tech) is. In short, LaTeX is a type of markup language used for research papers, along with articles, reports, and other such documentation, created in 1984 to make writing and publishing papers easier. Whilst useful for that, not many people outside of it seem to use LaTeX (and rightly so), due to it being used in such a niche but vital field. This document can help with understanding and getting to grips with LaTeX, and other such markup languages. 

## Getting Started
This Section will assume you are new to this fully. If you aren't, please skip.
What you will need to start will be:

- A LaTeX Editor or IDE (Either a web-based version, like [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com), or an Application IDE, such as [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/download) or [TexStudio](https://www.texstudio.org/).)
- Understanding of Warhammer 40K 10th Edition (a good source of information is [Wahapedia](https://wahapedia.ru/)
- Understanding of LaTeX (this will help you get comfortable with the main editing and creation of the Detachment, but if you want to customise or personlise the detachment, you will need to learn LaTeX more thoroughly)
- A github Account (optional, but required if you are using an IDE)

## Obtaining a copy of the template

### .zip file
The easiest way is by clicking on the `code` Button, and selecting "Download .Zip", which will automatically give you a compressed (.zip) file of the project. The rest of this will detail using a repository. You will also need to do this if you wish to import it into Overleaf or other web-based editors

### Repository
Another way is by using this template and creating a copy of the repo. To do so, Create a github account, This is important seeing as everything will revolve around this. When you have fully set up your account, return to this repo and find the `use this template` button, click it and select "Create a New Repository", and fill out the required fields. Once it is created, you can use a github client (like [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) or [Fork](https://git-fork.com/). Once you have set up your client, clone the repository.

# Setup Complete
Now that Setup is complete, We can move onto what you should expect in the .TeX document, which is the file you'll be using to edit the PDF. Please go to [This Markdown file](https://github.com/Fourman2004/warhammer40k-10e-latex/blob/master/README%20-%20Latex.md) for more guidance on how to go about LaTeX and to [This Markdown file](https://github.com/Fourman2004/warhammer40k-10e-latex/blob/master/Images/README.md) for how to go about images in the document.
