# Intro to Images

Hi, Here are the images stored in the LaTeX file. Technically for this, you will not need to edit any of the LaTeX for it to happen, and all images are denoted with `\includegraphics`. For more in-depth look into adding images and in more depth, I reccomend you take a look at [This](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Inserting_Images).

## Editing images in the TeX document.

This is probably the simplist thing you will need to do.

Both folders contain important images, and their source files. I will talk about the Header_Footer Folder first, before discussing the Stratagems folder.

### Header_Footer
In this folder, you will find the Header and the footer, which is the header without any of the faction iconography. Remove the "icon here text" and export it as a .PNG when you are done, hiding the faction icon and the Icon's background (the Diamond shape) when exporting the footer. I will also reccomend keeping a note of the Hexcode used for your theme. You can use this to change the tables hexcode. Whenever you see a table, you must change only the top hexcode when customising it, the rest should remain as white (or FFFFFF), unless you wish for a custom table design, then I reccomend looking at [This](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tables).

as mentioned, you only need to export it as a .PNG, and when doing so, select either Header or Footer and override the current file. When you next compile, you will see that it has changed.

### Stratagems
These are labelled as Stratagem_1, and to Stratagem_6. When you have finished editing and are exporting, please export as a .PNG to one of the Existing Stratagems and Override that file like you did with the header/footer. When you next compile, it should have changed. I will also reccomend when Exporting you remove the background, allowing the stratagem to blend with the document better, improving it's appearence overall.
